# SWIFT Code API Service

** Work in Progress **

This repository hosts the solution for the Remitly Home Exercise (Internship Application).

The primary goal of this project is to develop a Spring Boot application capable of parsing SWIFT/BIC code data from a provided file, storing this data efficiently in a MySQL database, and exposing the data through a RESTful API according to the exercise specifications.

* The Docker environment using Docker Compose (including the Spring Boot application service and the MySQL database service) is configured and operational.
* Implementation of the core functionalities (data parsing, persistence layer, API endpoints, tests) is currently underway.

**Key Technologies:**
* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.x
* Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
* MySQL 8.4
* Maven
* Docker & Docker Compose

**(Note: Detailed instructions for setup, build, running the application, API endpoint documentation, and testing procedures will be added upon project completion.)**
